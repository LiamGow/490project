To run `ourDeepDreamCode.py`, you need to install three packages:
```
pip3 install pillow
pip3 install IPython
pip3 install imageio
```

Dream code reads from imsrc, outputs to imout  

Hyperparemeters should be set in the Config file found in myLib.py  

Abstraction level indicates a bias towards layers nearer toward the beginning (or end) of the architecture
